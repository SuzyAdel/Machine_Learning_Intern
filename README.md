# Mentorness- ML internship
Hands-on projects and exercises tailored to reinforce key concepts and build practical experience. From basic algorithms to real-world applications of machine learning .
# Task 1: Reel Task 
Topic for Reel: Regularization in XGBoost: Explain regularization techniques used in XGBoost, such as shrinkage (learning rate) and tree pruning, to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.

The purpose of giving you this task is to:
1. Boost your skills and knowledge.
2. Put what you've learned into practice.
3. Encourage you to be creative.

# Task 2: Predictive Modeling for Disease Diagnosis

The purpose of giving you this task is to:
1. Enhance your data manipulation and preprocessing skills.
2. Apply data cleaning techniques to prepare datasets for analysis.
3. Ensure you understand the importance of data quality in machine learning projects.
   
Objective:
The objective of this project is to prepare a dataset for use in a predictive model by performing necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis. By the end of this task, you will have a clean and well-structured dataset that can be used to train reliable machine learning models for disease classification and prognosis.
